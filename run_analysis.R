#get the training datasets, only dataset needing features (as colnames) read above is the x_train
###Project Item #4 is accounted for here using the col.names

###Project Task #1 - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
#merge training and test datasets
merged_all <- rbind(merged_train, merged_test)
#using dplyr for ease of functionality. Create the tibble.
merged_all_df <- tbl_df(merged_all)

###Project Task #2 Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation 
###for each measurement.
#uses dplyr 'select' verb to extract activity, subject and the mean and standard deviation
#variables
mean_std_df <- select(merged_all_df, activity_num, subject_num, 
                      contains(".mean.."), contains(".std.."))

###Project Tasks #3/#4
####3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
###4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
###This is already covered above when the data was read with feature names as column names
#descriptive activity labels using dplyr join on activity_num
mean_std_df <- inner_join(mean_std_df, activityLabels)
#activity numbers are not needed as we have the labels now
mean_std_df <- select(mean_std_df, -activity_num)

###Project Task #5
###From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set 
###with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
#dplyr group_by is used to group the data frame by activity and then by subject
grouped_mean_std_df <- group_by(mean_std_df, activity_name, subject_num)
#dplyr summarize_all is used to get averages for all variables in the groups
final_tidy_data_df <- summarise_all(grouped_mean_std_df, funs(mean))
#write this dataset so that it's available in GitHub repo
write.table(final_tidy_data_df, "final_tidy_dataset.txt", row.names = FALSE)
