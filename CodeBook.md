# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project: CodeBook.md

The variables in the original datasets came from capturing accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals ```tAcc-XYZ``` and ```tGyro-XYZ``` (prefix ```'t'``` denotes time). The acceleration signal were then processed and separated into body and gravity acceleration signals ```(tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ)``` and then the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals ```(tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ)```. Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated ```(tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag)```. 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing ```fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag.``` (Note the ```'f'``` to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
```'-XYZ'``` is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag
```

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 
```
mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.
```

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

```
gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean
```

***The course project*** required us to combine the above variable values from training and test datasets with the corresponding activities and subjects (identified by numbers in separate datasets). Then we needed to create a new intermediate dataset containing only the mean and standard deviations variables for the activities and subjects.

The next level of processing required us to calculate average values at group levels where each group is a unique combination of an activity and a subject. The final variables are all mean values at the group level (mean values for an activity for a subject):
