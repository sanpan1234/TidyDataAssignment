# TidyDataAssignment
As described in the course project outline, the end goal of this project is to prepare a tidy data set from a bunch of 'messy' datasets. 

This repo contains the required artifacts:
1) a tidy data set as described below
2) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 
3) a README.md (this file), that explains how the only script for this project works.
