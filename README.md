# TidyDataAssignment
As described in the course project outline, the end goal of this project is to prepare a tidy data set from a bunch of 'messy' datasets. 

This repo contains the required artifacts:
1) a tidy data set as described below
2) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 
3) a README.md (this file), that explains how the only script for this project (run_analysis.R) works.

Following is a description of all the steps performed by the script (run_analysis.R):

1. Step 1: Download and unzip the 'messy' dataset zip file into a subfolder of the working directory. This root folder is referred to by the variable **data_root_folder**. The original data folder is _not included_ in the repo.
